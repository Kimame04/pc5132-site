## Hello 👋 ! 

We are a group of Year 5 Students, Kieran Mendoza, Ray Sim, Wang Hengyue and Ettikudiappan Srivishagan! This is our website for a PC5132 Module Project, and hope you enjoy! 

This website aims to tie in aerodynamics to Formula One, our favourite sport! 🏎 

Formula One is a wonderful sport, combining the best of driver ability with the greatest engineering minds in the world and the unpredictability of the races.

Hope you enjoy!
