In Formula 1 cars (or any form of racing for that matter), aerodynamics matters a lot to the performance of the car.

There are two key goals in aerodynamics in racing

1. Maximise **downforce** (and thus cornering grip)
2. Minimise **drag** (and thus improve straight-line speed)

While various teams have different design philosophies and principles for their cars, their technological innovations generally fall into one of these two categories - improving downforce, and/or reducing drag.
