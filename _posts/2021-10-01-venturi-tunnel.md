The Venturi Effect is an application of Bernoulli's principle, which essentially states that when the airflow is constricted, the velocity increases, and the pressure of the air decreases.

**How does this affect the production of downforce?**

By generating such a region of low pressure underneath the Formula One car, the car is 'sucked' to the ground as the higher pressure air would force the car down.
