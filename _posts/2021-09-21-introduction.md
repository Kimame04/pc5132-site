# Introduction

In Formula 1 cars (or any form of racing for that matter), aerodynamics matters a lot to the performance of the car.

There are two key goals in aerodynamics in racing

1. Maximise **downforce** (and thus cornering grip)
2. Minimise **drag** (and thus improve straight-line speed)

## What is downforce?

> 1. a force, produced by a combination of air resistance and gravity, that acts on a moving vehicle, having the effect of pressing it down towards the ground and giving it increased stability

Improving downforce enables the car to take corners at higher speeds before the car starts slipping (and losing traction). In short, slipping occurs because the centripetal force exceeds that of the amount of mechanical grip that the tyres can take.

Below is an image of a rear wing, a device in Formula One cars that is key to producing downforce.
