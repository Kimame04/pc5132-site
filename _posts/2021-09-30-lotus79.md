The **Lotus 79** is the first F1 car to incorporate ground effect in its design, and was used by the Lotus F1 team in the 1978 and 1979 season, to much success.

It won the 1978 constructor's championship in dominant fashion, due to its superior downforce levels compared to other cars at the time.

The famed vehicle is touted for starting the era of aerodynamics in Formula One!
