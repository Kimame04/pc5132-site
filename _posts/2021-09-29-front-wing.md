The front wing is the first part of the car that comes into contact with the air, and is thus responsible for directing the airflow around the car. This means that the aerodynamics of the rest of the car depends on how the front wing is designed to manipulate the incoming airflow.![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iaFeiJre8TfvUBTPbfk2lfinB6PhGverqInKwcMHjAeORonpEvoLekKv2K63PG9q8VUi5AFWdzWqWwjE4Eit1p7m5umYw_-R96JnnEldr42fSP6pzaTmpHB31j6SK9va7tUcKTk=s0)
